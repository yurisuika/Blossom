**Blossom** is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that makes oak leaves blossom and bear fruit! No longer do you have to destroy your tree to get those apples, now you can simply shear them off when they are grown! Flowering oak leaves will bloom from any oak leaves when pollinated by bees. Watch as bees nurture your apples from bud to pome! You can help speed up their growth with bone meal, if you so choose.

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch <branch> --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/blossom.git

cd ./blossom

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
