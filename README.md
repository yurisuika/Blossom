*Apples blossom upon leaves by the pollen from bees!*

### Give apples leaves to rest upon!
Blossom takes the humble apple and gives it its own tree. More than just that, apples will grow from the leaves with the help of bees. No longer do you have to destroy your tree to get those apples, now you can simply shear them off when they are grown! 

### Let nature take its course!
Apples are more than just a simple food that drop out of nowhere, they are a part of the tree and the surrounding ecosystem. Apple trees that have bees around will start to blossom flowers. When these flowers unfurl, bees may pollinate them, allowing them to grow into fruit! Fully grown fruit can be harvested by shears or may drop to the ground if left unharvested for too long (watch your head)!

Watch as bees nurture your apples from bud to pome! Just as bees may fertilize your apples, you may do the same with bone meal.

### Blossom more than just apples!
Blossom adds several registries for handling the process of Blossom's multi-block growth behavior. Modders may use these to add fruiting trees beyond just apples! Please take care to note that some of these registries require the use of Blossom's leaves blocks to function.
